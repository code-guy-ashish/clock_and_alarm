Project Title: Interactive Clock Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Project Description:
The Interactive Clock project involves building a dynamic and visually appealing clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to learn how to create an interactive web application that displays the current time, updates in real-time, and includes user-friendly features.

Project Objectives:

HTML Structure: Set up the HTML file to create the basic structure for the clock, including the hour, minute, and second display sections.

CSS Styling: Apply CSS to design an attractive clock interface, including the clock face, clock hands, and any additional visual elements.

JavaScript Functionality: Use JavaScript to fetch the current time from the user's device and update the clock's display accordingly.

Real-time Updates: Implement real-time updates so that the clock continuously reflects the current time, ensuring accuracy and precision.

User Interaction: Add interactive features, such as the ability to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, or the option to choose different clock styles.

Responsiveness: Ensure the clock is responsive and adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Project Deliverables:

HTML file with the clock's basic structure.
CSS file with styles for the clock interface.
JavaScript file containing the logic for fetching and updating the current time.
A fully functional interactive clock that displays the real-time and responds to user interactions.
Through this project, I will gain valuable experience in combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and functional web application. The finished clock will serve as an impressive addition to my portfolio and showcase my proficiency in front-end web development.
